    "# Predicting Pet Insurance Claims - Model Tuning and Predictions\n",
    "## 1 Introduction\n",
    "### 1.1 Background\n",
    "Whenever a pet insurance policy holder incurs veterinary expenses related to their enrolled pet, they can submit claims for reimbursement, and the insurance company reimburses eligible expenses. To price insurance products correctly, the insurance company needs to have a good idea of the amount their policy holders are likely to claim in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Project Goal\n",
    "The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model to predict how much (in USD) a given policy holder will claim for during the second year of their policy.\n",

Following this evaluation, we will select our final model and make predictions on our test set to generate final results. Our best model so far is using a **simple linear regression model with feature selection**. This resulted in a mean absolute error of **~\\\\$930**. So there could be a lot of room for improvement if we can find a model that better suits our data.\n",

    "* Grid Search on n_estimators / learning rate\n",
    "* Set other parameters and add rationale\n",
    "* Plot result of score at different learning rate (line plot?) or scatter plot of learning rate and n_estimator combinations\n",

    "* https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/02/complete-guide-parameter-tuning-gradient-boosting-gbm-python/\n",
    "* Tune max_depth and num_samples_split\n",
    "* Tune min_samples_leaf\n",
    "* Tune max_features\n",
    "The order of tuning variables should be decided carefully. You should take the variables with a higher impact on outcome first. For instance, max_depth and min_samples_split have a significant impact and we’re tuning those first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important Note: I’ll be doing some heavy-duty grid searched in this section which can take 15-30 mins or even more time to run depending on your system. You can vary the number of values you are testing based on what your system can handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, I’ll test max_depth values of 5 to 15 in steps of 2 and min_samples_split from 200 to 1000 in steps of 200. These are just based on my intuition. You can set wider ranges as well and then perform multiple iterations for smaller ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3** Tune sub-sample and loss functions\n",
    "\n",
    "As a next step, let's tune our gradient boosting model by setting a few of the parameters and starting with a simple grid search of the n_estimators parameter to find an optimal number of trees for the default learning_rate of 0.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though, GBM is robust enough to not overfit with increasing trees, but a high number for a particular learning rate can lead to overfitting. But as we reduce the learning rate and increase trees, the computation becomes expensive and would take a long time to run on standard personal computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping all this in mind, we can take the following approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Choose a relatively high learning rate. Generally the default value of 0.1 works but somewhere between 0.05 to 0.2 should work for different problems\n",
    "* Determine the optimum number of trees for this learning rate. This should range around 40-70. Remember to choose a value on which your system can work fairly fast. This is because it will be used for testing various scenarios and determining the tree parameters.\n",
    "* Tune tree-specific parameters for decided learning rate and number of trees. Note that we can choose different parameters to define a tree and I’ll take up an example here.\n",
    "* Lower the learning rate and increase the estimators proportionally to get more robust models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll implement a grid search for the hyperparameter tuning, but in this case, we'll use a Random Grid Search. This will greatly reduce the number of possible hyperparameter combinations involved in the search, saving value compute time. And even though the search won't be exhaustive, there's a high likelihood we will find a set of hyperparamters resulting in a result that is *close to* the best we could get in a full grid search."
