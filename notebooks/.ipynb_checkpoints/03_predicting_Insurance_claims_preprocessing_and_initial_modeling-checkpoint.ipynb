    "# Predicting Pet Insurance Claims - Pre-processing and Initial Modeling\n",
    "## 1 Introduction\n",
    "### 1.1 Background\n",
    "Whenever a pet insurance policy holder incurs veterinary expenses related to their enrolled pet, they can submit claims for reimbursement, and the insurance company reimburses eligible expenses. To price insurance products correctly, the insurance company needs to have a good idea of the amount their policy holders are likely to claim in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Project Goal\n",
    "The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model to predict how much (in USD) a given policy holder will claim for during the second year of their policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Notebook Goals\n",
    "* Split data into Train and Test sets\n",
    "* Complete any remaining feature engineering\n",
    "* Pre-process the data to prepare for modeling\n",
    "* Create and assess initial models"

    "At the end of exploratory data analysis, we had an updated data file for our pets data containing all pet records. As a quick review, here's a summary:\n",
    "* Shape - Our clean dataframe is 50000 rows with each row corresponding to a single pet.\n",
    "* Basic Info - For each pet, we have some basic info including species, breed, and age at time of enrollment.\n",

    "We can see that our cross-validation score starts to plateau around ~10000 training samples and then stays fairly steady up to the max sample size. In contrast, the training score starts off much lower, then jumps up and starts  to converge with the cross validation score as it plateaus. Given that the distribution of our data is irregular for the majority of our features and our target, it stand to reason that our training scores would improve as our sample size increases. \n",

    "Based on the fact that our cross-validation scores plateau at a sample size of ~10000, it's safe to say that more samples likely wouldn't improve our model performance at this stage. We can revisit learning curve as we get into some more advanced modeling in the next notebook."

    "So at this point, we have an initial model that performs reasonably well in terms of improvement over simply using the mean. With an improvement in accuracy of about \\$100 per customer, this could represent a significant cost savings when considering a customer base in the 10s of millions. Further, we managed to achieve this result while keeping our model extremely simple for now. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've completed the following steps:\n",
    "* Data cleanup for modeling by removing unnecessary features and features that would introduce data leakage\n",
    "* Feature engineering to add new features related to pet breed and pet age\n",
    "* Data preprocessing to handle the remaining categorical data\n",
    "* Baseline modeling to look at:\n",
    "    * Results of a simple dummy regressor using the mean\n",
    "    * Results of a simple linear regression model\n",
    "* Linear regression with feature selection along with some review and analysis of feature importance\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook, we'll look at a couple of more sophisticated modeling techniques to see if we can improve upon our results. Then, we'll take the best model and apply it to our test set to get a final assessment of the performance. \n",
